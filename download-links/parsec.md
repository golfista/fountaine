# ðŸ–¥ Parsec

Parsec is a proprietary desktop capturing application primarily used for playing games through video streaming. Using Parsec, a user can stream video game footage through an Internet connection, allowing one to run a game on one computer but play it remotely through another device. Although its main focus is gaming, Parsec can also be used as low-latency desktop sharing software. The Parsec client is available on most modern operating systems including Windows, macOS, Android, Raspberry Pi 3 and Linux.

Parsec also provides a paid "Parsec for Teams" version with additional features for artists and developers, such as additional administrative tools, better color accuracy and the ability to stream multiple screens at once.
