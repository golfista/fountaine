# ðŸŸ£ osu!

osu! is a rhythm game made by Dean "Peppy" Herbert in 2007. It has gotten good reviews and has been recommended by professional gamers as a way of improving cursor aim and gaining advantage in other games. A repository of the game, mostly written in C#, can be found in GitHub.

Most of the levels (beatmaps) are made by the community, which are made with the level creator that is in the game.
