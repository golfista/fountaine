# üê§ Five Nights At Freddy's 2

Five Nights at Freddy's 2 (FNaF 2) is a point-and-click survival horror video game developed and published by Scott Cawthon. It is the second installment in the Five Nights at Freddy's series, and a prequel to the first game. Like its predecessor, the game takes place in a fictional pizzeria where the player acts as a security guard who must defend themselves from the hostile animatronic characters that wander the restaurant at night.
