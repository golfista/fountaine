# ðŸ’« Freddy Fazbear's Pizzeria Simulator (FNAF 6)

Freddy Fazbear's Pizzeria Simulator\[b] is a point-and-click business simulation survival horror video game developed and published by Scott Cawthon. The game is free on Game Jolt for the Windows platform. Released on December 4, 2017, on Steam and Game Jolt, it is the sixth main installment of the Five Nights at Freddy's video game series, the seventh game overall, and is chronologically set after the events of the third game. Initially marketed as a simulation game where the player manages their own franchised pizzeria, the game is gradually revealed to continue its predecessors' concept of surviving against hostile animatronic characters for multiple nights in a row.
