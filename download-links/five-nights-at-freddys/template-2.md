# üêá Five Nights At Freddy's 3

Five Nights at Freddy's 3 (FNaF 3) is a point-and-click survival horror video game developed and published by Scott Cawthon. It is the third installment in the Five Nights at Freddy's series, and chronologically takes place thirty years after the events of the first game, in a horror-themed attraction based on the chain of restaurants featured in the first two games. The player takes on the role of an unnamed security guard who must defend themself from a decrepit animatronic called Springtrap that roams the attraction while battling hallucinations of other whithered animatronics.
