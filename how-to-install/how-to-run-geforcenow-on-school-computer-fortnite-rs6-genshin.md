# ðŸŸ¢ How to run GeforceNOW on school computer (Fortnite, RS6, Genshin)

## CURRENTLY TESTING â€¼â€¼â€¼â€¼â€¼â€¼â€¼

Update 9/14/23 - Please use [luna.amazon.com](https://luna.amazon.com) [amazon-luna-tutorial.md](../list-of-websites/amazon-luna-tutorial.md "mention") for now, since I don't think I will have a release date for a while of the GeforceNOW method, really, it's not that easy.

Update 9/12/23 - GeforceNOW App opens but doesnt load, trying to find a workaround for this.
