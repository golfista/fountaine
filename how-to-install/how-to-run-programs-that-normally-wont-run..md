# üìê How to run programs that normally won't run.

**First,** you need to go to your downloads on chrome/edge, should be at the top right corner of the screen or down left **(quick shortcut Ctrl + J)** [or click here.](chrome://downloads)

**Find the program that you want to run.**

After that, you will grab the zip file from the browser, and then drag it to WinRAR.

After that, you need to find the .exe file that opens the program, this can vary, but should be pretty simple.

When you find it and open it, the program will start to extract.

After waiting (maybe a while) the program you downloaded will open!

Now to not repeat the process of launching winrar every time, you may pin the program you downloaded to the taskbar, you do this by right-clicking on the program icon, and then, pin to taskbar.

## You are now done! remember to be careful and try to not wide-spread this like the XD folder, since it may be taken down.
